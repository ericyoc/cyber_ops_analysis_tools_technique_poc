The Cyber Kill Chain
https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html

Developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain® framework is part of the Intelligence Driven Defense® model for identification and prevention of cyber intrusions activity. The model identifies what the adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objective.

MITRE ATT&CK
https://attack.mitre.org/

MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.


Diamond Model
https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/diamond-model-intrusion-analysis

The Diamond Model can work in tandem with other frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain. Each framework focuses on different components or elements of a cyberattack, helping analysts obtain a holistic picture of the incident.

STIX

Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI). STIX is open source and free allowing those interested to contribute and ask questions freely.

## Importance of Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK Frameworks mapped to Tools and Techniques

Mapping the Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks to tools and techniques offers several benefits:

1. **Targeted Analysis**: By identifying the appropriate tools and techniques for each stage of the attack lifecycle, analysts can focus their efforts on the most relevant data points and efficiently investigate malicious activities.

2. **Enhanced Understanding**: Mapping frameworks to tools and techniques helps in understanding the attacker's perspective, tactics, and procedures, enabling security professionals to develop effective defense strategies.

3. **Skill Development**: Familiarizing oneself with the tools and techniques associated with each stage of the attack lifecycle enhances the skills and knowledge required for malware analysis, reverse engineering, and software exploitation analysis.

4. **Proactive Defense**: Understanding the mapping allows security professionals to proactively identify potential attack vectors, implement appropriate security controls, and strengthen their overall security posture.
